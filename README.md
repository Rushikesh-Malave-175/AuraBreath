### ðŸ§  Inspiration

I often found myself breathing shallow and inconsistent while coding. After reading a book on pranayama, I practiced it one day while coding. The amount of mental activeness and focus I observed was unbelievable. The problem was I often lost focus from either the breathing, or from the work i was doing, it was difficult to do two things at once. I wanted an app which would show colors so that i could sub consciosly keep track of my breathing.

### Example Use Case

The app is great for practicing **box breathing**, **Wim Hof**, or other breathwork routines for relaxation, stress relief, or focus, while you're working.
